## The Story

As I'm building the "in-a-jiffy" application this week, my goal is to make it easy for avid readers to search for new books to read and keep a list to purchase.

## Description


Presume as a user, you want to be able to search for books on the book search engine homepage so that you can easily find the books you are looking for. You will be presented with a menu of the options "Search for Books" and "Login/Signup", as well as an input field to search for books and a submit button. By clicking on the Search for Books menu option you will be presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button. As you are logged out and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button there will be several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site. If you click on the Login/Signup menu option, a modal appears on the scrren with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up. Similarly, if the toggle is set to Signup, then you will be presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, and a password, as well as a signup button.
Furthermore, if the toggle is set to Login, then you will be presented with two inputs for an email address and a password, as well as a login button. If you enter a valid email address and create a password and click on the signup button, then your user account is created and you're logged in to the site. Then, if you enter your account's email address and password and click on the login button, the modal closes and you're logged in to the site.
When you're logged in to the site, the menu options change to Search for Books, an option to see your saved books, and Logout. If you're logged in, you can search for books and save the information of the books you like to your account.
If you click on the option to see your saved books, you will see a list of all the books you have saved to your account, and you will be able to remove any book from the list by clicking the Remove button.
Lastly, if you click the Logout button, you will be logged out of the site and returned to the login page.

## Mock-Up

Let's start by revisiting the web application's appearance and functionality.

As you can see in the following animation, a user can type a search term (in this case, "star wars") in a search box and the results appear:

![Animation shows "star wars" typed into a search box and books about Star Wars appearing as results.](./Assets/21-mern-homework-demo-01.gif)

The user can save books by clicking "Save This Book!" under each search result, as shown in the following animation:

![Animation shows user clicking "Save This Book!" button to save books that appear in search results. The button label changes to "Book Already Saved" after it is clicked and the book is saved.](./Assets/21-mern-homework-demo-02.gif)

A user can view their saved books on a separate page, as shown in the following animation:

## Getting Started

In order for this application to use a GraphQL API, you’ll need to refactor the API to use GraphQL on the back end and add some functionality to the front end. The following sections contain details about the files you’ll need to modify on the back end and the front end.

**Important**: Make sure to study the application before building upon it. Better yet, start by making a copy of it. It's already a working application&mdash;you're converting it from RESTful API practices to a GraphQL API.

### Back-End Specifications

You’ll need to complete the following tasks in each of these back-end files:

* `auth.js`: Update the auth middleware function to work with the GraphQL API.

* `server.js`: Implement the Apollo Server and apply it to the Express server as middleware.

* `Schemas` directory:

	* `index.js`: Export your typeDefs and resolvers.

	* `resolvers.js`: Define the query and mutation functionality to work with the Mongoose models.

		**Hint**: Use the functionality in the `user-controller.js` as a guide.

	* `typeDefs.js`: Define the necessary `Query` and `Mutation` types:

		* `Query` type:

			* `me`: Which returns a `User` type.
		
		* `Mutation` type:

			* `login`: Accepts an email and password as parameters; returns an `Auth` type.

			* `addUser`: Accepts a username, email, and password as parameters; returns an `Auth` type.

			* `saveBook`: Accepts a book author's array, description, title, bookId, image, and link as parameters; returns a `User` type. (Look into creating what's known as an `input` type to handle all of these parameters!)

			* `removeBook`: Accepts a book's `bookId` as a parameter; returns a `User` type.
			
		* `User` type:

			* `_id`

			* `username`

			* `email`

			* `bookCount`

			* `savedBooks` (This will be an array of the `Book` type.)

		* `Book` type:

			* `bookId` (Not the `_id`, but the book's `id` value returned from Google's Book API.)

			* `authors` (An array of strings, as there may be more than one author.)

			* `description`

			* `title`

			* `image`

			* `link`

		* `Auth` type:

			* `token`

			* `user` (References the `User` type.)


### Front-End Specifications

You'll need to create the following front-end files:

* `queries.js`: This will hold the query `GET_ME`, which will execute the `me` query set up using Apollo Server.

* `mutations.js`:

	* `LOGIN_USER` will execute the `loginUser` mutation set up using Apollo Server.

	* `ADD_USER` will execute the `addUser` mutation.

	* `SAVE_BOOK` will execute the `saveBook` mutation.

	* `REMOVE_BOOK` will execute the `removeBook` mutation.

Additionally, you’ll need to complete the following tasks in each of these front-end files:

* `App.js`: Create an Apollo Provider to make every request work with the Apollo Server.
	
* `SearchBooks.js`:

	* Use the Apollo `useMutation()` Hook to execute the `SAVE_BOOK` mutation in the `handleSaveBook()` function instead of the `saveBook()` function imported from the `API` file.

	* Make sure you keep the logic for saving the book's ID to state in the `try...catch` block! 

* `SavedBooks.js`:

	* Remove the `useEffect()` Hook that sets the state for `UserData`.

	* Instead, use the `useQuery()` Hook to execute the `GET_ME` query on load and save it to a variable named `userData`.

	* Use the `useMutation()` Hook to execute the `REMOVE_BOOK` mutation in the `handleDeleteBook()` function instead of the `deleteBook()` function that's imported from `API` file. (Make sure you keep the `removeBookId()` function in place!)

* `SignupForm.js`: Replace the `addUser()` functionality imported from the `API` file with the `ADD_USER` mutation functionality.

* `LoginForm.js`: Replace the `loginUser()` functionality imported from the `API` file with the `LOGIN_USER` mutation functionality.
